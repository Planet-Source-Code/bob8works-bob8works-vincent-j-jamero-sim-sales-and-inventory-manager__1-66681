### Description

A simple application that can support purchasing, sales and automated inventory management. I earned a lot from PSCODE.com that is why I want to share this piece of code to all beginners and for those who want to learn VB6. It includes 16 user controls and a modified LynxGrid control which originally created by Richard Mewett. E-mail me at bob8works@yahoo.com if you need have questions or inquiries. Thanks!
